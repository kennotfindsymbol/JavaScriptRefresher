# JavaScriptRefresher

### Motivation
Built for someone (or myself) if they have not worked with JavaScript for a while. Not a language tutorial.

### Code and Concepts
Run `node filename.js` in your terminal.
- `play.js`: `var`, `let`, `const`, function, array, spread and rest operators, destructuring
- `async.js`: asynchronous programming

### Summary
#### Weakly Typed Language
- No explicit type assignment
- Data types can be switched dynamically

#### Object-Oriented Language
- Data can be organized in logical objects
- Primitive and reference types

#### Versatile Language
- Runs in browser & directly on a PC / server
- Can perform a broad variety of tasks (listen for events, re-render DOM, work with files and databases)
